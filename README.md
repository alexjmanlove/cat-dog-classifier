# Is that a 🐈 or a 🐕?

## PyTorch convolutional neural network for binary classification.

Images of cats and dogs taken from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetankv/dogs-cats-images) were used to train a convolutional neural network for the task of binary image classification. In the end this simple network achieved 80% accuracy on the test set.
